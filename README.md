I am currently working at the University of Groningen as a PhD Student in the Stratingh Institute of Chemistry under the supervision of [Prof. Robert Pollice](https://pollicegroup.web.rug.nl/rob.html). I'm generously funded by the EU and am a part of the MSCA Doctoral Network [CATALOOP](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/cataloop/). 

Previously, I worked at [Aganitha](https://www.aganitha.ai/), an early-stage startup in Hyderabad, India. 

I pursued my undergrad (Chemistry major, 2020) and masters (Organic Chemistry, 2022) at Ruia College, affiliated to the University of Mumbai.

Currently, I am working on developing reliable computational representations for chiral moieties and building ML models for stereoselective reactions. I am passionate about open-source and open-science. I share my views [here](https://medium.com/@nishimaru30).
