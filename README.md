I am currently working at the University of Groningen as a PhD Student in the Stratingh Institute of Chemistry under the supervision of Prof. Robert Pollice. I'm generously funded by the EU and a part of the MSCA Doctoral Network [CATALOOP]([url](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/cataloop/)). Previously, I worked at [Aganitha]([url](https://www.aganitha.ai/)), an early-stage startup in Hyderabad, India. I pursued undergrad (Chemistry major, 2020) & masters (Organic Chemistry, 2022) at Ruia College, affiliated to the University of Mumbai. Currently, I am working on developing reliable computational representations for chiral moieties and building ML models for stereoselective reactions. I am passionate about open-source and open-science. I share my views [here]([url](https://medium.com/@nishimaru30)).
